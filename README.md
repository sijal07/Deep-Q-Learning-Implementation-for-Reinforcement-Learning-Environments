# Deep-Q-Learning-Implementation-for-Reinforcement-Learning-Environments


🧠 Deep Q-Learning Model
📘 Overview

This project implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm — a popular Reinforcement Learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards.
The trained model learns optimal actions using a neural network that approximates the Q-value function.

🎯 Objective

The goal is to train an AI agent to maximize its cumulative reward in a simulation environment (such as CartPole-v1 or LunarLander-v2) using Deep Q-Learning.

🚀 Key Features

Implementation of Deep Q-Network (DQN) from scratch using PyTorch

Uses Experience Replay to stabilize learning

Implements ε-greedy exploration strategy

Saves and loads trained models

Includes training visualization and performance video

🧩 Algorithm Overview

Initialize Environment and Q-Network

The environment (e.g., gym.make('LunarLander-v2')) is initialized.

A neural network is built to approximate Q-values.

Experience Replay

Experiences (state, action, reward, next_state, done) are stored in memory.

Random samples are taken to train the model and avoid correlation between experiences.

Target Network

A separate target network is used to stabilize updates.

Training Loop

For each episode:

The agent interacts with the environment.

Chooses actions using the ε-greedy policy.

Updates the Q-network using the Bellman equation:

Model Evaluation

After training, the agent’s performance is recorded (see rl-video-episode-0.mp4).

🧰 Requirements

Install the dependencies before running the notebook:

pip install gym
pip install torch
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib


If you’re using LunarLander, also install Box2D:

pip install box2d box2d-py gym[box2d]

▶️ How to Run

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Deep_Q_Learning_model.ipynb


Run all cells to train the model.

After training, watch the saved video (rl-video-episode-0.mp4) to see how the agent performs.

🎥 Result

The file rl-video-episode-0.mp4 shows the agent after training — successfully balancing or landing based on the environment used.

📈 Future Improvements

Implement Double DQN for better stability

Add Prioritized Experience Replay

Train in more complex environments (e.g., Atari games)

Use GPU acceleration for faster learning
